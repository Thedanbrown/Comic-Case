# Description
This is a group project that was completed by Daniel Brown, Tyler Kandarian and Janaee Wallace as part of the Georgia Tech Bootcamp Project 2. This application is an MVP comic book collector website where like minded collectors and curators can showcase their priceless collections to a community of likeminded individuals. In the long term, this closed but close-knit community will also support a collector marketplace where collectors can auction off and compete for valuable comics to build out their collections. Success within this group project was defined by ensuring the following:
1. Use of Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API
2. Use of Handlebars.js as the template engine
3. Use of MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database
4. Use of both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data
5. Use of at least one new library, package or technology that was not covered during the Georgia Tech bootcamp class
6. A folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm
7. Authentication (express-session and cookies)
8. Protected API keys and sensitive information using environment vairables
9. A deployed application using Heroku (with data)
10. A polished, responsive UI
11. An application that accepts and responds to user input
12. Meets good-quality coding standards
13. This professional README :)
